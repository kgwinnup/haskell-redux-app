# Haskell, Scotty, React, Redux Web app

This is a template web app project which utlizies some cool technologies, haskell and scotty for the backend and reactjs and redux on the front end. 

# Building requirements

This project requirest stack and yarn.

# Frontend building

The frontend portion is built with yarn tool. First navigate to the `frontEnd` directory. Once there type `yarn watch` to begin build and staging files.

# Backend 

The backend utilizes `stack` and can be built with `stack build`. I use [stack-run](https://github.com/yamadapc/stack-run) to build and run. With this tool type `stack run` and it will build and start serving up the project.
